Problem Statement:
  The 2020 Presidential Election is often called ‘the election of our lifetimes’, and the voter turnout was in record numbers, even during a critical period where the United States is recording daily records for higher cases in COVID-19. The votes between the two main presidential candidates Donald Trump and Joseph Biden were closer than expected by most, and both candidates fought battles to take control of key battleground states. We want to create a relational database that shows how several key factors that were projected to play important roles in this election differed by county and state, including the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, percentage of citizens with no health insurance, and percentage of citizens with no high school diplomas.

2. A CSV file with different factors expressed in percentages to show how each county in the United States is affected by lack of health insurance, lack of education, and the number of COVID-19 cases as well as other factors.
